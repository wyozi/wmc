Wyozi Media Center is an addon for Garry's Mod, that adds extensive media playing capabilities. It is built to be easily extendable. For example displaying video uses an isolated MoonScript class, which means it is easy to display video on whatever prop/surface/screen location you want.

# Installation

Simplest way to get WMC is to download the latest version from https://github.com/wyozi/wmc/releases.

If you want to use the latest version on git, you'll need to download [MoonScript](http://moonscript.org/) compiler. You can download the compiler binaries for Windows from http://moonscript.org/bin/moonscript-0.2.6.zip.

Run ```make_moonscript.bat``` to compile all MoonScript files in WMC.
