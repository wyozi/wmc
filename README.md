Wyozi Media Center is an addon for Garry's Mod, that adds extensive media playing capabilities. It is built to be easily extendable.

## WMC Code? On Github?

Yes! This doesn't mean you lost money if you bought the script on coderhire, as only CoderHire purchasers have access to support in installing or using WMC. If you want support in either of these things, please [me a CoderHire PM](http://coderhire.com/profile/personalmessages/send/1443) or [add me on Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/wyozi).

## What's the license for WMC?

At the moment there is no license. Please see http://choosealicense.com/no-license/ for what this actually means. In a nutshell I will not accept any pull requests.

## What can I use the issue tracker for?

**Bugs** in code and suggestions. If you report an issue that has nothing to do with code, but is something related to problems in installation etc, I will close the issue. Please buy the script on CoderHire and contact me directly, if you have problems with something like that.
